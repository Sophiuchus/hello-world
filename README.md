## An exercise in GitHub work flow
Hello, my nmae is Garth. Welcome to my initial repository for practicing branching, commits, and pull requests.
Funny how things seem so conveluded until you try them, I could not make much sense of Github by just reading about it.
I am about to commit the changes I just made on my branch for the ReadME file update. 
Then I will submit a pull request to merge into my main branch.
